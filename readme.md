# Rust Everywhere

A collection of projects experimenting with how to _run_ server-side Rust app in various platforms.

* app - A basic note-taking application.
* api - The API which the app communicates with
* server-side ([demo](https://rust-everywhere-server-side.logankeenan.com/)) - Standard server side implementation
* spa ([demo](https://rust-everywhere-spa.pages.dev/)) - A client-side server leveraging service workers
* spa-server ([demo](https://rust-everywhere-spa-server.logankeenan.com/)) - Server-side implementation for the first initial page load followed by the client-side server for
subsequent _requests_
* cloudflare - Server-side implementation running in Cloudflare. Coming soon, see an existing [example](https://github.com/logankeenan/axum-cloudflare-adapter/tree/main).
* ios/android/desktop - Coming soon with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
